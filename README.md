# Exploratory Data Analysis of Haberman's Survival Dataset

The project delves into performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Haberman's Survival Dataset, which provides insights into the survival of patients who underwent surgery for breast cancer at the University of Chicago's Billings Hospital.

## Dataset Overview
The Haberman's Survival Dataset comprises attributes related to patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer, including age, year of operation, number of positive axillary nodes detected, and survival status. The dataset aims to facilitate analysis and prediction of survival rates based on these attributes.

## Project Objectives
1. Understand the characteristics and distributions of the dataset attributes.
2. Explore the relationship between different attributes and survival status.
3. Identify any patterns or trends that may emerge from the data.
4. Perform statistical analysis to extract insights into factors influencing survival rates.

## Key Tasks Explored
1. Data Loading: Load the Haberman's Survival Dataset into a suitable data structure for analysis.
2. Data Exploration: Analyze the dataset to understand its structure, attributes, and summary statistics.
3. Data Visualization: Visualize the distributions of individual attributes, explore relationships between attributes, and examine survival status trends.
4. Statistical Analysis: Conduct statistical tests and analyses to uncover significant correlations or patterns in the data.
5. Conclusion: Summarize key findings and insights obtained from the EDA process, highlighting any noteworthy observations or conclusions.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Data Visualization Libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

  
## Conclusion
Through this exploratory data analysis, we aim to gain insights into the factors influencing the survival of breast cancer patients post-surgery. By analyzing the dataset's attributes and their relationships, we can contribute to a better understanding of breast cancer treatment outcomes and potentially aid in improving patient care and prognosis prediction.
